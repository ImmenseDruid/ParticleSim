# This is a Particle Simulation

This is a Temporary Readme file until I create an actual readme

## Particles
Particles are represented as a position, a velocity, an acceleration, a mass and a radius. they also have their own color to distinguish some particles from others for ease of verification of correct simulation.


## Quadtree
The quad tree as it stands is quite the work in progress, it is slightly more "advanced" than the typical quadtree implementation but still not quite as advanced as I would like to see.
